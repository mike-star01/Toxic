# 🪦 Situationship Graveyard

A darkly humorous app where users memorialize failed talking stages, flings, and almost-relationships — from "we matched once and never met" to "we hooked up 4 times and he ghosted me."

## 💀 Core Concept

Situationship Graveyard is a cathartic and entertaining way to process failed romantic connections. Users can:

- **Add Graves**: Memorialize failed situationships with names, causes of death, and epitaphs
- **Emotional Logging**: Track the details of each situationship (dates, kisses, fights, etc.)
- **Graveyard View**: Browse all your failed connections in a beautiful graveyard layout
- **Revive Feature**: Dramatically "revive" situationships when they come back from the dead
- **Collection**: Build your personal collection of emotional damage like trading cards

## 🔧 Features

### 🪦 Add a Situationship (Grave Entry)
- Name or nickname (e.g., "Gym Rat" or "Tinder Tom")
- Cause of death: ghosted, breadcrumbed, situationship, etc.
- Optional epitaphs and dates
- Emotional autopsy with detailed questions

### 📊 Emotional Logging / Reflection
The app asks comprehensive questions:
- Did you ever meet in person?
- How many dates?
- Did you kiss / hook up / fall in love / fight?
- How long did you talk?
- Were you exclusive?

### 🏛️ Collection View (Graveyard Mode)

### 🧟 "Revive" Button
