# 💀💌 Situationship Graveyard – App Concept

## 🪦 Core Premise

An app where users memorialize failed talking stages, flings, and almost-relationships — from "we matched once and never met" to "we hooked up 4 times and he ghosted me."

---

## 🔧 Core Features (MVP+)

### 1. Add a Situationship (Grave Entry)

* Name or nickname (e.g., “Gym Rat” or “Tinder Tom”)
* Their "cause of death": ghosted, breadcrumbed, situationship, etc.
* Upload a pic (optional) or use a generated “tombstone avatar”
* Date started / date ended (ish)

### 2. Emotional Logging / Reflection

App asks:

* Did you ever meet in person?
* How many dates?
* Did you kiss / hook up / fall in love / fight?
* How long did you talk?
* Were you exclusive?

App generates a “summary card” like a trading card or autopsy report.

> Vibe: like Pokémon cards for your emotional damage.

### 3. Collection View (Graveyard Mode)

* Displays all entries laid out in a graveyard or gallery
* Tap to view details
* Optional voiceovers or epitaphs like:

  > “Here lies the man who said he wasn’t ready for a relationship and got a girlfriend 2 weeks later.”

### 4. "Revive" Button 🧟

* If you talk to them again, press the “Revive” button
* Plays a dramatic animation (e.g., thunder crack, gravestone breaks open)
* Changes status to: “Back From The Dead 👻”

If revived multiple times:

> “You’ve revived this man 4 times. This is now necromancy.”
