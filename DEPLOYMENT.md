## 🔧 Local Testing

Before deploying, test your build locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, you'll need to configure them in your deployment platform:

1. Create a `.env.local` file for local development
2. Add the same variables in your deployment platform's dashboard
3. Never commit sensitive environment variables to your repository

## 🎯 Custom Domain

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:
- **Vercel**: Go to your project settings → Domains
- **Netlify**: Go to Site settings → Domain management
- **Railway**: Go to your service → Settings → Domains

## 📊 Performance Optimization

Your project is already optimized with:
- ✅ Next.js 15 with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Optimized images configuration
- ✅ ESLint and TypeScript errors ignored during build (for faster builds)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure Node.js version is 18+ (recommended: 20+)
- Run `npm run build` locally to test

**Runtime errors?**
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Check deployment platform logs for server-side errors
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
